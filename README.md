# ESP32-Pen-Drive-Access
The ESP32-WROOM-32E Development Board with Direct Pen Drive Access is a compact and feature-rich IoT development platform designed for USB storage, wireless communication, and battery-powered applications. Built around Espressif's powerful ESP32-WROOM-32E module, this board integrates a CH376S USB Host controller for direct interfacing with USB flash drives, allowing the ESP32 to read and write files without an SD card.

For portable and low-power use cases, the board includes a TP4056 charging circuit with built-in protection, enabling seamless charging of a single-cell Li-ion or Li-Po battery. A modern USB Type-C connector allows for easy programming and power input, while full access to ESP32’s GPIOs makes it ideal for sensors, actuators, and user interfaces.
